  <section>
    <h2>2. Our Service</h2>
    <p>EasyAbroad connects students preparing for a study or work abroad experience with peer consultants who have previously lived in their destination city.

    <p>All consultants are required to submit proof documents (e.g. transcripts, confirmations) verifying their experience abroad. These documents will be reviewed and deleted after successful verification. Consultants must provide accurate information and keep their profiles up to date.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Cancelation</h2>
    <p>If a student does not attend a session and fails to cancel at least 24 hours in advance, the consultant will still receive full payment, and the student will not be eligible for a refund.</p>
